Project Title: COVID-19 and Employee Burnout: A Data-driven Analysis

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employee burnout, particularly within the IT sector. The objective is to gain insights into the prevalence of burnout, understand contributing factors, and develop strategies to mitigate its occurrence. The analysis utilizes openly available data from Kaggle, which includes employee-related attributes such as ID, date of joining, gender, company type, WFH availability, designation, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, and burn rate.Link to the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blurredmachine/are-your-employees-burning-out .

Key Features:
1. Data Analysis: The project involves exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and statistical techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends related to burnout.
2. Burnout Categorization: Instead of predicting a specific burnout rate, the project categorizes employees into different burnout levels based on the burn rate. The categories include extremely burned out, moderately burned out, slightly burned out, and not burned out.
3. Gender Analysis: The project examines gender differences in burnout levels to identify potential disparities and understand the impact of gender on employee well-being.
4. Company Type Analysis: The project explores the relationship between company type (service-based or product-based) and burnout levels to identify variations in burnout risks across different organizational settings.

Project Steps:
1. Data Preparation: The data is preprocessed, cleaned, and analyzed to ensure its suitability for the analysis.
2. Visualizations and Statistics: Visualizations and statistical techniques are employed to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and trends within the data.
3. Burnout Categorization Model: A classification model is developed to categorize employees into different burnout levels based on the burn rate. The model is trained and evaluated using appropriate machine learning techniques.
4. Gender and Company Type Analysis: The data is analyzed to examine gender differences and the impact of company type on burnout levels.
5. Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis findings, insights are derived to understand the factors contributing to burnout and suggest strategies to mitigate its occurrence.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up the development environment using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
3. Download the dataset using the opendatasets library developed by Jovian.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform data analysis, build the burnout categorization model, and generate insights and recommendations.
5. Interpret the analysis results, utilize the provided visualizations, and leverage the findings to develop strategies for employee well-being and burnout prevention.

By conducting an in-depth analysis of employee burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to provide valuable insights for organizations to understand and address burnout risks. The findings can guide the implementation of effective strategies to enhance employee well-being, support work-life balance, and foster a positive and healthy work environment.
